/**
 * Choicely MCP Local Server
 *
 * Exposes local tooling for Android/iOS build, install, launch, and device management.
 * This server is designed to run locally and provides tools that require access to
 * local SDKs, emulators, simulators, and connected devices.
 *
 * Key flows handled by this server:
 * 1. Demo app pipeline – fetch the SDK demo repo, build the Android/iOS binaries,
 *    install them to the selected target, and launch/diagnose with logs or screenshots.
 * 2. Device & emulator helpers – list/boot AVDs and simulators, capture device info,
 *    logs, and screenshots, manage running processes, and uninstall when cleanup is needed.
